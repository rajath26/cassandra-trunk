 * 'end-of-component' flag, that allow precise selection of composite ranges.
 *
 * We also make a difference between "true" composites and the "simple" ones. The
 * non-truly composite will have a size() == 1 but differs from true composites with
 * size() == 1 in the way they are stored. Most code shouldn't have to care about the
